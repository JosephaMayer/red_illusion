    // Note: instead of swapping the <canvas> tag with the <img> tag
    // as done above, we could have just transferred the contents of
    // the image directly:
    //
    //     image.src = canvas.toDataURL('image/png');
    //
    // This has two disadvantages. First, it is much slower, so it
    // would be a bad idea to do this repeatedly. If you are going
    // to be repeatedly updating a filter it's much better to use
    // the <canvas> tag directly. Second, this requires that the
    // image is hosted on the same domain as the script because
    // JavaScript has direct access to the image contents. When the
    // two tags were swapped using the previous method, JavaScript
    // actually doesn't have access to the image contents and this
    // does not violate the same origin policy.
